<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Your task is to write a function which takes as argument tuple of tuples of fractions and return their sum. The fractions will look like (x, y) where 'x' is the numerator and 'y' is the denominator. For example, (2, 3) means 2/3. If the numerator is greater than the denominator (after addition) you should extract the integer part and write it before the fraction. For example:<br>
fractions(((2, 3), (2, 3))) = "1 and 1/3", because the result will be 4/3 (numerator is greater than denominator) and you can extract the integer part (1) and fraction (1/3).
Make note that the word 'and' is required if the result has the both parts - integer and fraction.<br>
If the result hasn't the fraction part and has only integer - you should return it as 'int'-type, not 'str'. If it hasn't the integer part - just return it like string 'N/D' where N - the numerator and D - the denominator.
